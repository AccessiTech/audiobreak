# AudioBreak Full Stack Scraper

This project is a full stack web application with a Python (FastAPI) backend for scraping websites, applying business logic, and serving a React frontend. The backend exposes REST endpoints for scraping and data retrieval. The frontend allows users to specify a site to scrape, trigger the process, and view results.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AccessiTech/audiobreak
   cd audiobreak
   ```

### Backend
1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the frontend dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 by default. If you encounter CORS issues, you can use a Vite proxy. Add this to `frontend/vite.config.ts`:

```ts
// ...existing code...
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/scrape': 'http://localhost:8000',
  },
},
// ...existing code...
```

This will forward API requests to the FastAPI backend during development.

## Docker

To build and run the full stack app with Docker (frontend + backend):

1. Build and start the containers:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the app from your browser at:
   - `http://localhost:9876/` (from the host machine)
   - `http://<host-ip>:9876/` (from other devices on your local network)

The frontend is served by Nginx on port 9876 and all API requests are proxied to the FastAPI backend (port 8000).

To stop the AudioBreak container only:
```sh
docker compose stop audiobreak
```

### Running the Docker Image on a Remote Server

To deploy and run this app on a remote server:

1. Copy the project files to your server (or build the image locally and push to a registry).
2. On the server, build and start the containers:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
   The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.

3. Open port 9876 (and 8000 if you want direct API access) in your server's firewall/security group.

4. Access the frontend from any device:
   - `http://<server-ip>:9876/`

5. (Optional) To rebuild after code changes:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

6. To stop the AudioBreak container only:
   ```sh
   docker compose stop audiobreak
   ```

- `/main.py` — FastAPI backend entry point
- `/requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `/frontend/` — React frontend (to be created)

## About This Project & AI Collaboration

This application was built in close collaboration with GitHub Copilot (AI). The developer guided the process through iterative prompts and feedback—a process affectionately called "vibe coding." Most of the code, architecture, and even UI/UX details were generated by AI, with the developer acting as a creative director, reviewer, and vibe-setter. This project is a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration in modern software development.
