# AudioBreak Full Stack Scraper

This project is a full stack web application with a Python (FastAPI) backend for scraping websites, applying business logic, and serving a React frontend. The backend exposes REST endpoints for scraping and data retrieval. The frontend allows users to specify a site to scrape, trigger the process, and view results.

## Backend
- Python 3, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- Scrapes a specified website and applies business logic
- Exposes REST API endpoints

## Frontend (Vite + React)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the frontend dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 by default. If you encounter CORS issues, you can use a Vite proxy. Add this to `frontend/vite.config.ts`:

```ts
// ...existing code...
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/scrape': 'http://localhost:8000',
  },
},
// ...existing code...
```

This will forward API requests to the FastAPI backend during development.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url> audiobreak
   cd audiobreak
   ```

### Backend
1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend
Instructions for the frontend setup will be added after scaffolding the React app.

## About This Project & AI Collaboration

This application was built in close collaboration with GitHub Copilot (AI). The developer guided the process through iterative prompts and feedback—a process affectionately called "vibe coding." Most of the code, architecture, and even UI/UX details were generated by AI, with the developer acting as a creative director, reviewer, and vibe-setter. This project is a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration in modern software development.
